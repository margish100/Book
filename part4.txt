Question 1:
FastAPI is built on top of Starlette and Pydantic, which allows it to handle asynchronous requests efficiently. Asynchronous requests are managed through Python's async and await syntax, enabling non-blocking I/O operations. This approach is particularly beneficial for I/O-bound and high-latency tasks, such as accessing databases, sending HTTP requests, or reading and writing files.
Benefits Over Synchronous Code:
    1. Improved Performance: Asynchronous code can handle more requests by not waiting for the current task to complete before moving on to the next one. This non-blocking behavior leads to improved performance, especially for I/O-bound operations.
    2. Better Resource Utilization: By leveraging concurrency, asynchronous applications can make better use of system resources, as threads are not idly waiting for I/O operations to complete.
    3. Scalability: Asynchronous applications can scale more efficiently to handle large numbers of simultaneous connections, which is particularly beneficial for APIs expected to serve many clients at once.



Question 2: Dependency Injection in FastAPI
Dependency Injection (DI) in FastAPI is a design pattern that allows for the decoupling of components and their dependencies. This pattern facilitates easier testing, maintenance, and extension of applications. In FastAPI, 
dependencies can be functions or classes that are automatically instantiated and inserted by the framework into your path operation functions, based on the type annotations.




Question 3: Code Walkthrough
For a code walkthrough, it's important to have a specific piece of code or a concept in mind. Since the context for a walkthrough wasn't provided, I'll give a brief overview of creating a simple FastAPI application, touching on both asynchronous requests and dependency injection:
pythonCopy code
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from . import crud, models, schemas
from .database import SessionLocal, engine

models.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

app = FastAPI()

# Dependency
def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()

@app.post("/users/", response_model=schemas.User)
async def create_user(user: schemas.UserCreate, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    db_user = crud.get_user_by_email(db, email=user.email)
    if db_user:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Email already registered")
    return crud.create_user(db=db, user=user)

@app.get("/users/", response_model=List[schemas.User])
async def read_users(skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100, db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
    users = crud.get_users(db, skip=skip, limit=limit)
    return users
